    <p>But this burger is only made for one person. 6/7 doctors would recomend eating the Octuple Bypass burger atleast 3 times every week. New studies have found that people need more calorie intake then ever before. This is because people are becoming infected with the 6/7 Virus and it drains the human body of all energy.</p>

    <p>Now before you start, make sure you have all these ingridents.</p>
    <ul>

  <li>16 Sliced tomatoes</li>
  <li>35 Sliced onions</li>
  <li>Mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard (optional)</li>
  <li>Lard (optional, for cooking) </li>
</ul>

  <li>Prepare the patties: Form the eight beef patties. You can optionally add lard to the patties for extra richness, as the restaurant does. </li>
  <li>Grill the components:
Grill the eight beef patties to your desired doneness.
Cook the 40 slices of bacon until crispy. 
Grill the buns, if desired.</li>
  <li>Assemble the burger:

Continue layering until you have used all eight patties.
Place the top bun on the finished burger.</li>
